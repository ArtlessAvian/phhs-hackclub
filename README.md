## About
This is the website I made for my high school's after school coding club.
It includes general stuff a website would normally have, including our own materials
+ resources from external sources. Feel free to contribute.

## TODO:
* <s>Add *more* content to homepage</s>
* <s>Link navigation bar to workshops, presentations, etc.</s>
* <s>Figure out how external CSS and JavaScript files work on GitHub. Lol.</s>
* <s>Add more content to About Us page</s>
* <s>Add team page on About Us page</s>
* <s>Implement registration page and possibly events page (?)</s>
* <s>Add footer. Will add at end too.</s>
* Add HTML&CSS and Java tutorials

## Future plans/implementations:
* I'm planning on completely redesigning the site sometime around next year,
or perhaps leaving the new generation of Hack Club leaders make it. I'm just
really unsatisfied with the messiness of the site; I want it to be cleaner and
more easily navigable, perhaps having a maximum of only 3 pages.

## Future implementations
* I really want to redesign the site entirely to make it more compacted, having 
the "essentials" and the homepage joined together, while moving the registration page
to another page. The current state of the website is very messy, and I'm just hoping
to clean it up a bit.
