# Piedmont Hills Hack Club

## VERSION 2.0.0
### Changes:
* New banner;
* Updated team page with social media icons;
* Implemented form validation;
* Added tutorials;

## About
This is the website I made for my high school's after school coding club.
It includes general stuff a website would normally have, including our own materials
+ resources from external sources. Feel free to contribute.

## TODO:
* <s>Add *more* content to homepage</s>
* <s>Link navigation bar to workshops, presentations, etc.</s>
* <s>Figure out how external CSS and JavaScript files work on GitHub. Lol.</s>
* <s>Add more content to About Us page</s>
* <s>Add team page on About Us page</s>
* <s>Implement registration page and possibly events page (?)</s>
* <s>Add footer. Will add at end too.</s>
* Add HTML&CSS and Java tutorials

## Future implementations
* I really want to redesign the site entirely to make it more compacted, having 
the "essentials" and the homepage joined together, while moving the registration page
to another page. The current state of the website is very messy, and I'm just hoping
to clean it up a bit.

## Credits:
* particleground.js JavaScript library
* Bootstrap CSS library
* formspree.io (Server that redirects form submissions to email)
