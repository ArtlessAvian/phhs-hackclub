# Piedmont Hills Hack Club
**VERSION 1.0.0 IS OFFICIALLY FINISHED.**

This is the website I made for my high school's after school coding club.
It includes a homepage, about us page, events page, materials page, and registration page.
Shoutout to the members of other branches of Hack Club for helping me get this website up.
Also thanks to GitHub for the free DNS from Namecheap (You can get it from the student pack).

BUGS:

<s>At the moment, there is a small bug where the footer is cut off on some pages. It could
be the result of some of the stylings I used for certain elements pushing the sticky
footer down, or just the way GitHub processes CSS stylesheets (IDK). 
Currently working on it.</s>

Fixed. Problem was unclosed elements.

TODO:
* <s>Add *more* content to homepage</s>
* <s>Link navigation bar to workshops, presentations, etc.</s>
* <s>Figure out how external CSS and JavaScript files work on GitHub. Lol.</s>
* <s>Add more content to About Us page</s>
* <s>Add team page on About Us page</s>
* <s>Implement registration page and possibly events page (?)</s>
* <s>Add footer. Will add at end too.</s>
* Add HTML&CSS and Java tutorials

Future implementations:
* Learn PHP to add functionality (will do at the very end, tentative actually)
* Add more tutorials for other languages

Credits:
* particleground.js JavaScript library
* Bootstrap CSS library
* formspree.io (Server that redirects form submissions to email)
