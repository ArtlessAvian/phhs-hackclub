# Piedmont Hills Hack Club

## VERSION 2.0.0
### Changes:
* New banner;
* Updated team page with social media icons;
* Implemented form validation;
* Added ShipIt link;

## About
This is the website I made for my high school's after school coding club.
It includes a homepage, about us page, events page, materials page, and registration page.
Shoutout to the members of other branches of Hack Club for helping me get this website up.
Also thanks to GitHub for the free DNS from Namecheap (You can get it from the student pack).

## TODO:
* <s>Add *more* content to homepage</s>
* <s>Link navigation bar to workshops, presentations, etc.</s>
* <s>Figure out how external CSS and JavaScript files work on GitHub. Lol.</s>
* <s>Add more content to About Us page</s>
* <s>Add team page on About Us page</s>
* <s>Implement registration page and possibly events page (?)</s>
* <s>Add footer. Will add at end too.</s>
* Add HTML&CSS and Java tutorials

## Future plans/implementations:
* I'm planning on completely redesigning the site sometime around next year,
or perhaps leaving the new generation of Hack Club leaders make it. I'm just
really unsatisfied with the messiness of the site; I want it to be cleaner and
more easily navigable, perhaps having a maximum of only 3 pages.

## Credits:
* particleground.js JavaScript library
* Bootstrap CSS library
* formspree.io (Server that redirects form submissions to email)
