# Piedmont Hills Hack Club

## About
Piedmont Hills Hack Club is an after-school coding club branching from the
organization[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). We hold club meetings every
Tuesday after seventh period. For more info, check the website at
http://phhshackclub.tech.
## Structure
We try our best to make our meetings similar to mini-hackathons, meaning that
each club meeting presents an opportunity to learn and create.
### Workshop Days
On these days, the meeting will consist of a live demo covering workshops
provided by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). Students can work at their own
pace; the live demo only serves to give the students an idea of what the process
of coding is. Of course, these activities are optional; more experienced members
can spend these meetings working on their projects.
### Project Days
This is the main purpose of being in this club. Our goal isn't to teach our
members to code, our purpose is to give members the knowledge and fundamentals
to use in the making of their projects. After all, the best coders aren't good
because they learn from classroom lectures, but because they get their hands
dirty by coding. So, make something!

Project days will be *every* club meeting, either during workshop demos or
whatever remaining time after the demo. Each member will choose a team and pick
a topic they want to work on, and will have 2-3 months to work on it. Our meetings
will only be 1 hour every week, so be sure to work on your project at home too,
if you have the time.

Our suggested topics are: programs that solve minute, daily problems;
websites that provide services better than the mainstream ones
(think of improvements! UI, functionality, etc.); or whatever you deem enjoyable
and fun (it can be game or a meme generator). Your project doesn't have to be
something useful, it can be the silliest, most unnecessary idea you can think
of. Just build something!

Remember, while we provide the materials for you to get started, we won't be
there to guide you every step of the way. Be resourceful; the club leaders are
there to help, but you should use Google or Stack Overflow as your primary
learning material while working on your projects (don't worry,
Googling stuff to fulfill the current task is what every programmer does).

From **jsneak** (Hack Club leader at William Fremd High School):
> "I learn the most when I start a new project. It's because I have to
Google stuff to fulfill the current task I'm working on."

**TL;DR**: Learn by doing. That's our philosophy.

### Presentation Days
2-3 months after you start on your projects, we will give one day to finalize
everything and prepare for presentations. The meeting after prep day will
consist of groups going up and giving a short presentation + a live demo of
their project. There is no minimum time required, nor is there a time limit.
If you don't want to present in front of the club, it's perfectly fine! These
presentations are **optional**. However, we would prefer club members to show the
club leaders their projects + a live demo during prep day if they do not want
to present on Presentation Day.

After all projects are presented, you can ship yours to Hack Club's
[ShipIt!](https://shipit.hackclub.com) platform, where other Hack Club members
around the world can view it! (Note: A GitHub account is required for this).

## Recommended Prerequisites
We don't have requirements for you to join the club, but we suggest at least
these prerequisites (some of these are easy enough to learn on your own!), but
we will still go over these in the first few meetings anyway:
* Familiar with the GitHub platform
* Access to a personal laptop with permissions to install programs on them
    * IDEs, text editors, etc.
* Have a Facebook account
    * Info regarding subsequent meetings and events
    will most likely be announced in our Facebook group
    * If you do not have a Facebook, be sure to check our
    [site](https://phhshackclub.tech) regularly for updates and announcements!
* Attend Piedmont Hills High School
